								<p>Hi, my name is Mossaab and i'm a Data Analyst. I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Applied Mathematics and Data Science 
									(Business Analytics, Paris AI SCHOOL).
								</p>
								<p>Since I was young, I have always enjoyed looking at how people act and try to sort their beahvior type (this person is friendly, 
									this person is quick to be upset, calm etc...). 
									So that's how I look at big data sets : to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve. 
									Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me.
								</p>
								<p>I have been working as a Data Analyst for more than a year and a half with experience in the Food & Beverages industry, Argriculture 
									and Retail. 
									I have worked on more than 20 Data Analytics and Data Science projects which gives me the ability to translate complex questions 
									into understandable insights.
								</p>
								<p>As a Data Analyst, I know exactly how you can use data optimally within your business. Based on your objectives, we will make 
									a plan to reach the right insights.

								<h3 class="major">Apprenticeship - Description & Achievements</h3>
								<h4>Role Decription : </h4>
								<blockquote>
								<p>As a Data Analyst at FYRE EUROPE, I played a pivotal role in integrating project management skills with advanced data 
								science and analytics expertise. My responsibilities covered a diverse range of tasks aimed at optimizing organizational 
								processes and leveraging data-driven insights for strategic decision-making.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<h4>Role Architecture :</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/10.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									One key aspect of my role involved collaborating with cross-functional teams to identify project requirements and objectives. 
									Employing project management skills, I ensured that timelines were adhered and objectives were achieved.<br><br>
	
									My skills in data science and analytics came into play as I collected, processed, and analyzed large datasets to build  
									meaningful patterns and trends. By applying classification models and data visualization techniques, I provided valuable insights 
									that informed business decisions.<br><br>
	
									Furthermore, I actively contributed to the development and implementation of data-driven strategies, i identified opportunities 
									for operational optimization such as bettering the coordination between heads of departements after analyzing the projects timelines
									data over the last 2 years.
									</p>

								<h4>The Data Analytics part : </h4>
								<blockquote>
									The idea is to provide a digital solution for the restaurants owners that allows them to create a relationship with their 
									customers and manage their stores with high levels of proficiency and simplicity. Creating customer loyalty has great 
									returns for both partiesâ€”suppliers and customers.<br><br>
									
									To ensure the success of this relationship, the information locked within printed receipts in 
									restaurants and other meal-providing establishments is highly valuable. Both analyzing and enriching the raw information 
									contained in this data source can play a huge role in ensuring the satisfaction and costs optimization for 
									both suppliers and customers.<br><br>

									&#8594 66% of customers want brands to understand their unique needs and expectations.
									<br>
									&#8594 52% want all offers that come from a brand to be personalized.
								</blockquote>
								<h4>Illustration : </h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>Let's Focus on 'Products Names' : </h4>
								<blockquote>
									The <b>Product Name</b> is an important element on which my main data project during my apprenticeship was built on, alongside
									with the Word <b>Data Enrichement</b> <br><br>
									
									It's clear from the data diagram that I have access to the restaurant's data. Using Python or SQL, I can access the database 
									in real-time, verify the received data, report errors, and extract data for <b>analytical</b> or <b>enrichment</b> purposes.
									.<br><br>
									To obtain a comprehensive understanding of customer consumption and provide insights about the food and beverages market, as well 
									as brand and product category performance, I initially needed to acquire as much information as possible about the products names.<br> 
									The raw data only contains three components related to the products : Label, Quantity and Cost.
								</blockquote>

								<h4>Problem & Goals :</h4>
								<blockquote>
								My objective was to generate additional information related to the products names. To achieve this, using web scraping techniques
								i constructed a large pre-enriched dataset with more than 40k entries containing all the products names with their respective 
								brands and categories to cover all products names that could potentially appear in printed receipts.<br>
								</blockquote>

								<h4>Data Enrichement process :</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/12.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<h4>Challenges</h4>
								<blockquote>
								<p>
								One of the biggest challenges I faced during this long-term project was finding suitable data to train my unsupervised model. 
								Fortunately, I came across a dataset with over 500k entries from the Open Food Facts API. After meticulous cleaning, removal of 
								erroneous inputs, and addressing missing values, I focused on entries in both French and English languages. Through this process, 
								I successfully narrowed down the dataset to more than 40k entries that are now accurately classified.
								</p>	
								</blockquote>
								<h4>VALUE OF THIS PROJECT</h4>
								<blockquote>
								<p>
								The Value of this project is ensuring that the data accurately and thoroughly represents the audience.
								Accurate, enriched data is the key to creating targeted, personalized customer experiences.
								</p>
								<h4>Achievements : </h4>
								<ol>
									<li>Identify target sales points.</li>
									<li>Launch commercial operations in the form of challenges.</li>
									<li>Track restaurants data in real-time.</li>
									<li>Give strategic insights into the market :<br>
										-Market penetration.<br>
										-Category performance.<br>
										-Brand performance.<br>
										-Detailed product analysis.
									</li>
								</ol>
								</blockquote>
								<h4>TECHNIQUES & TOOLS I USED : </h4>

								</blockquote>
								<h4>What's the next step ?</h4>
								<blockquote>
									As of now, I am refining the structure and accuracy of the classification process. This involves updating 
									and adding new entries for previously non-existing products. Additionally, I am conducting more feature 
									engineering campaigns on the columns to maximize the integrity & enrichment of the final results.

								<h3>CASE : HOW CAN I OPTIMIZE THE SALES FUNNEL ?</h3>
								<p>For a webshop I have done an extensive analysis to optimize the sales funnel. 
									The webshop wanted to know when people drop out during the ordering process and whether a 
									distinction could be made between different types of customers. When the sales funnel is 
									optimized according to the analysis below, turnover can potentially increase by 5.8%.
								</p>
								<hr>
								<h3>&#8594 HOW MANY VISITORS DOES THE WEBSHOP HAVE AND HOW MANY ORDERS ?</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>In 2021, the number of visitors increased because of digital campaigns.</li>
									<span class="image center"><img src="images/2.jpg" alt="" /></span><br>
									<li>The percentage of unique visitors remained relatively stable over the past three years.</li>
									<span class="image center"><img src="images/1.jpg" alt="" /></span><br>
									<li>The number of orders increased along with the number of visitors, but the number of items per
										order didn't reach the level they hoped for.</li>
									<span class="image center" ><img src="images/3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								</ul>
								<hr>
								<h3>&#8594 WHAT DOES THE SALES FUNNEL LOOK LIKE AND WHERE DO VISITORS DROP OUT ?</h3>
								<p>Together with the webshop we identified the processes a visitor goes through until the purchase is done. 
									Using Google Analytics and the own systems of the webshop we were able to check which visitors visit the 
									website and which process they go through.
								</p>
								<span class="image main" ><img src="images/4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>More than 60% of the visitors come via organic search, these are visitors who found the website 
									via a search engine. 14% of the traffic comes from visitors who entered the website themselves 
									in the browser, followed by e-mail (9%), social (5%), referral (3%) and other (6%).</p>

								<p>When visitors reached the website, I found three situations in the order process where people 
									often do not complete their order. For each situation I looked at how to improve this.</p>
								<h4>Case & Solutions</h4>
								<ol>
									<li>People add products to their shopping cart, but they do not view the contents of the total basket 
										( loss of 2.6% of the visitors ).<br>
										<b>Solution</b> : Display the icon of the shopping basket more prominently and if there are at least two 
										items in the shopping cart, display a pop-up to navigate to the total shopping basket.
									</li>
									<li>After people viewed their total shopping basket, 2.2% leaves the website during the process of logging 
										in or creating an account.<br>
										<b>Solution</b> : Allow people to pay as a guest without having to create an account.
									</li>
									<li>1% of the visitors leave the order process after they saw the total order amount. The two most common 
										causes are unexpected costs (delivery costs) or unaccepted voucher codes.<br>
										<b>Solution</b> : Mention delivery costs clearly on the website and show the telephone number if a 
										voucher code is not accepted.
									</li>
								</ol>
								<hr>
								<h3>&#8594 WHICH CHANNELS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE ?</h3>
								<p>Upon having a deeper look into the order process, I discovered that visitors arriving through emails 
									tend to have a higher likelihood of making a purchase. This can be due to the seamless login experience 
									users have when they click on the email link. Consequently, the dropout rate in the ordering process, specifically 
									between viewing the shopping basket and entering delivery details, is significantly reduced.
								</p>
								<span class="image center" ><img src="images/5.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p>Emails prove particularly impactful during special occasions. The graph illustrates a surge in orders 
									surrounding events like Mother's Day and holidays, primarily influenced by email campaigns.
								</p>
									
								<p>In response to these findings, a comprehensive email strategy was suggested and developed. This strategy covered 
									a range of considerations such as email frequency, optimal send-out times, and use of discounts.
								</p>
								<hr>
								<h3>&#8594 WHAT IS THE AVERAGE ORDER SIZE ?</h3>
								<p>We would like to increase the number of orders, but it is also interesting to increase the number of items per order. 
									That's why I looked at the number of items ordered per channel.</p>

								<p>The average order size is 1.4 items per order. Social is a channel where people do not often place an order, but the 
									average order size is high, followed by referrals and e-mail.
								</p>
								<span class="image center" ><img src="images/6.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<hr>
								<h3>RESULTS</h3>
								<p>Based on this report, i gave recommendations and insights during a presentation to the webshop that resulted in an 
									immediate increase of returns that was reported to me after 3 months of implementation.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/17.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>Introduction : </h4>
								<blockquote>
								<p>
									Fascinated by UFOs, aka 'Unidentified Flying Objects' , I delve into the space where theoretical physics intersects with 
									the unexplained. The peculiar aero-behavior exhibited by the unidentified flying objects challenges conventional physics laws, 
									this subject matter has targeted my curiosity about potential breakthroughs or civilizations pushing the boundaries of physics.<br>
									My interest in this project lies in exploring a relatively large number of UFO sightings as potential indicators of the truth 
									behind this intriguing phenomenon.</p>

								<h4>&#8594 First conclusion : </h4>
								<blockquote>	
									-After an initial analysis of the dataset, the following actions were taken to facilitate data visualization in the next stage :
									<ul>
										<li>Some columns were renamed for easier readability.</li>
										<li>The 'datetime' column was split into distinct columns.</li>
										<li>The 'comments_len' column was transformed into a numeric column.</li>
										<li>Values in the 'shape' column were grouped into a new column.</li>
										<li>Some columns that did not have significant importance were removed following the aforementioned preprocessing.</li>
										<li>NaN values were not replaced with other values but were removed, considering the large number of rows.</li>
									</ul>
								</blockquote>
								<h4>&#8594 Feature EDA & Visualisation : </h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/20.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>&#8594 second conclusion : </h4>
								<blockquote>	
									-After analyzing the data, we can draw the following conclusions:
									<ul>
										<li>UFOs were most frequently observed during the summer season and in the countries of USA and GB, that can be due to the mostly
											clear sky during summer seasons and the populations high densities.</li>
										<li>The longest duration of a UFO sighting was recorded in the countries CA and USA.</li>
										<li>The majority of observations were noted during the night, raising doubts about the shape of the UFOs.</li>
										<li>The most commonly reported UFO shapes are Round, Light (in the sky), and Triangle.</li>
										<li>The most active in writing comments are from the countries AU, with frequent mentions of the round, square and light UFO shapes, 
											in the second place comes GB, with comments regarding a light in the sky.</li>
										<li>During the night time, the most frequently observed types of UFOs were a light in the sky and round UFOs, during the day, the same 
											shapes of UFOs were mentioned, mainly a light in the sky and round UFOs.</li>
										<li>As it can be observed from the graphs, those who have had encounters with UFOs generally show a very positive attitude and pronounced 
											enthusiasm towards these experiences, while reactions of fear and unease seem to be less widespread. According to the statistical 
											analysis based on comments, it is found that approximately 66.8% of people have described these encounters as full of excitement 
											and positivity, while those who have expressed negative reactions, characterized by fear and unease, make up around 34.5%.</li>	
									</ul>
								</blockquote>
								<h4>&#8594 data preprocessing : </h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/21.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<blockquote>	
								I will train a regression algorithm to predict the latitude and longitude of locations where UFOs might appear 
								in various cities around the world :
								</blockquote>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/22.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<blockquote>	
								I chose the Random Forest model for regression due to its ability to handle large datasets and complex features. This algorithm provides robust 
								and accurate results in regression problems with intricate data structures. Significant performance observed in our evaluations and the alignment 
								with the test data have confirmed this choice.
								</blockquote>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/23.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<blockquote>
									<ul>
										<li>Scatterplot: This scatterplot graphically represents the model's performance and shows remarkable accuracy. Virtually all points 
											form a straight diagonal line from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner. This pattern suggests an excellent fit of the model 
											to the data, highlighting a notable alignment.</li>
										<li>Histogram: The histogram graph provides insights into the frequency of differences between predicted and actual values of the model. 
											Emphasizing symmetry, centrality, and dispersion, we observe that the histogram is centered around the value 0. This feature indicates 
											a correct trend in the model overall, as most errors revolve around the central point.</li>
